I've always been fascinated by the world of computers and technology. From a young age, I was intrigued by how lines of code could bring ideas to life on a screen. My journey in the field of computer science began during my college years at Hunter College.

Through countless hours of coding, debugging, and problem-solving, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and gained a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. My passion lies in creating efficient and elegant solutions to complex problems.

One of my most exciting projects was developing a web application that streamlined data analysis for a research team. This project allowed me to leverage my programming skills to make a real-world impact. The satisfaction of seeing my code contribute to meaningful results further fueled my desire to excel as a programmer.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others and contribute my expertise. I'm a firm believer in the power of open source, and I actively contribute to projects that align with my interests. I'm excited to continue exploring new technologies, refining my skills, and making a positive mark on the world through my passion for programming.
